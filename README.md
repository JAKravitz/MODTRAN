# MODTRAN
Atmospheric radiative transfer modeling for aquatic synthetic dataset development.

<br>Parent script is RunBatch_v5.m
<br>Test output HydroLight data is located in folder 'test'
<br>May need to adjust paths pointing to hydrolight data in line 6 of FindHyCases_v5.m and line 37 in ExecuteCase_ver5.m
<br> Built from MODTRAN 5 [MATLAB wrapper](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/31961-derekjgriffith-matlab-modtran-5)
